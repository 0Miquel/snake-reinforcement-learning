# Snake Reinforcement Learning

Requirements:
- Python 3.5+
- OpenAI Gym
- Numpy
- Pytorch (cpu)
- PyQT 5 for graphics
- Snake environment: https://github.com/telmo-correa/gym-snake

In this project two different methods have been used to build a reinforcement learning agent capable of playing snake game, achieving better mean score than a human player.
- Tabular method
- Linear neural network

Additionally, a convolutional neural network has been built to achieve better results, but we have not achieved the expected results. We think it is due to lack of hardware resources, as we are unable to train with bigger batch sizes.
